Ruby is widely regarded as a language for developing Web Applications. 

This is an attempt to use Ruby for solving Competitive Programming problems on various platforms. 

The code will be updated soon after the contest is over. Since I am still getting acquainted to Competitive Coding, solutions for all problems may not be available immediately. 

Please feel free to comment on any improvements required in my coding style.
